# Book Summaries Website

## About
This is a small static website built using only HTML.  
It contains a home page and 5 separate pages, each with a short summary of a book.

## Why I Made This
This was my first step into software development.  
The goal was to understand how HTML pages work, how to link them together, and to finish a real project instead of only watching tutorials.

## Tech Stack
- HTML only

## Note
The site is intentionally simple and left unchanged to preserve it as the starting point of my development journey.
